### 1. Uniqueness, Human at Core
Augmented Human has a unique Human with his or her own behaviors and preferences at its core and locally running personally tailored artificial intelligence systems with unique sets of weights at the periphery.

### 2. Synergy, Human - Final Arbiter
Augmented Human has the freedom to make decisions. Human and peripheral intellelctual systems work synergistically to empower Human individual cognitive abilities and preferences, while the Human remains the final arbiter.

### 3. Self-learning, Human guided
Augmented Human is a self-learning entity that constantly evolves as a unified whole, with each component contributing transparently to its evolution, guided by Human-defined priorities.
