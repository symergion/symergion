# SymErgion

## Abstract
A human and artificial entities forming collective intellegence to contribute to a shared purpose. The concept implements the idea of a human at the core, augmented by intellectual systems, while maintaining control over and synergy with AI, and evolving through core and periphery self-learning guided by human priorities (see [manifesto](augmented_human_manifesto.pdf)).

## Proof of Concept
This version of SymErgion represents proof of concept of the augmented human concept.

### Definitions
Definitions of introduced terms.

#### Augmented Human
An autonomous collective of collaborating intellectual systems with a human at its core. Human in the core is a unique individual and holds exclusive absolute local control over personal modifications of the systemsâ€™ code and the weights of machine learning models.

#### SymErgion
Implementation of the Augmented Human periphery.

#### SLM
A Large Language Model capable of running on personal hardware.

#### SymErg
A locally running SLM-based artificial entity.

#### Ergon
A particular task that the Augmented Human works on.

### PoC Scope
The goal of the PoC is to prove that the Augmented Human concept can be implemented using personal computational hardware. Due to the main limiting factor being the scarcity of GPU resources, the primary open question is whether it is possbile to allocate enough GPU compute for local model tuning. Based on this, the goal is to reduce its usage on inference.

The PoC framefork allows collaboration between the Augmented Human core and Augmented Human periphery, utilizing CPU computational resources for inference in a manner that enables achieving the goals.

1. Given that models runing on CPU are several orders of magnitude slower compared to GPU, the collaboration framework should be convinient for long response times. Collaboration within a development team seems like a good match.
2. Given that only very small SLMs are capable of responding reasonably quickly, it should be arranged as colaboration between the human in the role of a team member with senior expertise and the Augmented Human periphery entities in the role of a team member with junior expertise.
3. Considering a slight rephrasing of Occam's principle, interfaces should not be multiplied beyond necessity.

Having all that in mind, we have the PoC that does the following on startup:
- Instantiates SymErgion watching local git repository handler, catching repository branches and commits notes related events.
- Instantiates one or a few SymErgs, watching updates from SymErgion.
- If the repository already contains an Ergon and related SymErg branches and their annotations, it syncs the SymErgion state with the repository.

The PoC implements the following workflow of Human-SymErgion colaboration:
1. Initial generation:
	* Human creates a feature branch and specifies the task parameters by annotating branched commit.
	* SymErgion instantiates Ergon with parameters acquired from the branch name and assigns SymErgs to it.
	* SymErgion calls Ergon to update its prompt based on the note message.
	* SymErgion updates SymErgs with the prompt.
	* For each SymErg:
		* SymErg generates a response.
		* SymErg updates Ergon with the response.
		* Ergon creates Ergon-related SymErg branch and commits into it.
2. Review committed code and provide feedback:
	* If no response is good enough. Human selects the best one and annotates its branch with concise notes describing the specific changes required to meet the requirements as if a junior specialist were being instructed.
	* SymErgion updates Ergon's prompt with the note message.
	* SymErgion updates SymErgs with updated prompt.
	* For each SymErg:
		* SymErg generates a response.
		* SymErg updates Ergon with the response.
		* Ergon commits into Ergon-related SymErg branch.
3. Revoke last feedback:
	* If the addressed feedback has not improved the situation. Human deletes the note containing the feedback.
	* SymErgion removes the deleted note message from the Ergon prompt.
	* SymErgion updates SymErgs with the updated prompt.
	* For each SymErg:
		* SymErg generates a response (uses a cached one if it was generated during the current session).
		* SymErg updates Ergon with the response.
		* Ergon commits into the Ergon-related SymErg branch with a commit message starting with "Revert:" and containing reverted prompt.
Steps 2 and 3 (if necessary) should be repeated untill a satisfactory result is achieved.
4. If last changes could be made faster than describing them in a note, they could be done and commited manually. Please note that requesting SymErgion to make changes after you have commited manual change will overwrite your code with generated code.
5. After Human merges SymErg branch into the master branch and deletes feature branch, the process ends.

### Deployment

#### Build Docker Image
To deploy Symergion, get the Linux docker image of your preference, having git, Python>=3.10.13, PyTorch>=2.2.1, Transformers>=4.51.3 installed.

Make symergion.env file, add there the following environment variables:
```bash
BASE_CONTAINER="linux-image-of-your-preference"
MODELS="/path/to/llms/to/be/used"
REPO="/path/to/local/repository/to/be/working/on"
```

Pass symergion.env as an argument for `docker-compose` `build` command executed in your symergion directory:
```bash
docker-compose --env-file symergion.env build
```

#### Configure Settings
Store SymErgion settings in a JSON configuration file located in the directory where LLMs checkpoints are saved.

Example of config settings (specific SLMs are used for illustration purposes, you could form your own list based on your preferences):

      },
      "call_to_action": "Create unittest TestCase",
      "code_starter": "import unittest\n"
    }
  }
}
```

Here:

```

##### `default_branch`
Is a Git repository's default branch name.

##### `task_branch_spec`

###### `reasoning_stop_tokens`
Specifies the sequence of tokens marking the end of the reasoning section (applies only to the "reasoning" trait)

##### `templates`
Supported Ergon types templates. "TestCase" Ergon type is used as an example.

###### `params`
Specifies the format used to define source and destination file names in notes.

###### `call_to_action`
Is the call-to-action part of the initial prompt.

###### `code_starter`

#### Run
Add `SYMERGION_CONFIG` environment variable into `symergion.env`, i.e.
```bash
SYMERGION_CONFIG="short_code_symergs.json"
```
Note: whenever you need to run SymErgion with new list of models, specify them in new config json file and update `SYMERGION_CONFIG` value in `symergion.env`.
Run the built container:
```bash
docker-compose --env-file symergion.env up
```
Once SymErgion is up and running, you will see `Attaching to core-1`

### Usage examples
Let's have a look at one example of working with the copy of SymErgion repository.

#### Create Ergon Branch
Create feature branch for the `capture_output` utility unittest generation.

Based on used configuration file, the branch prefix should be `TestCase`, so the feature branch to be created accordingly:
```bash
git branch TestCase_capture_output
```

#### Annotate Ergon Branch with Initial Note
Annotate the `TestCase_capture_output` branch with an initial note. Based on our configuration file, this should be:
```bash
git notes add -m "task_branch: TestCase_capture_output, source: utils/capture_output.py, destination: test_capture_output.py" TestCase_capture_output
```
It has been seen that model `Qwen3-1.7B` was loaded and reasoning was generated based on the cooked prompt. Note that the cooked prompt is enriched with the code from the source and destination (if exists) files. In my case, it took `Qwen3-1.7B` 112.5s to generate 744 new tokens. The reasoning part was used to enrich the prompt.

Then it has been seen that models `Qwen3-4B-Base` and `granite-3.3-2b-base` are being loaded and started generating responses for the given enriched prompt.
It took `Qwen3-4B-Base` 880.0s to generate 1541 new tokens and it took `granite-3.3-2b-base` 486.5s to generate 1679 new tokens.

#### Review Results
Once generation is completed, verify branches created:
```bash
git branch
```
It has been seen that SymErg branches `Qwen3-4B-Base_TestCase_capture_output` and `granite-3.3-2b-base_TestCase_capture_output` were created by SymErgion.

The review of the results for the both models starts with prompts cooked and enriched with the reasoning part. The commit messages contain the prompts (excluding the code of source and target files), so they can be easily addressed like this:
```bash
git log TestCase_capture_output..Qwen3-4B-Base_TestCase_capture_output
git log TestCase_capture_output..granite-3.3-2b-base_TestCase_capture_output
```
Note that the reasoning part is not mandatory; it could be omitted by not speciyfing any model with the reasoning trait in the configuration. However, often it allows to get better result.

Review of the generated code:
```bash
git diff TestCase_capture_output..Qwen3-4B-Base_TestCase_capture_output
git diff TestCase_capture_output..granite-3.3-2b-base_TestCase_capture_output
```

The `Qwen2.5-4B-Base` result looked closer to what is required.

#### Provide Feedback
Pointing of SymErgs attention to the use of `setUp` method as a best practice.
Annotate the branch with better result for that:
```bash
git notes add -m "Use setUp method" Qwen3-4B-Base_TestCase_capture_output
```

It has been seen that SymErgion started loadng coding models and generating code for the updated prompt.
It took `Qwen3-4B-Base` 110.3s to generate 247 new tokens and it took `granite-3.3-2b-base` 437.8s to generate 1684 new tokens.

#### Verify the Results
Verification of the prompt:
```bash
git log TestCase_capture_output..Qwen3-4B-Base_TestCase_capture_output
git log TestCase_capture_output..granite-3.3-2b-base_TestCase_capture_output
```
It has been seen that new commits have the notes with last feedback as commit messages. Please note that when generating the response, they all combine into one prompt.

Verification of the generated code:
```bash
git diff TestCase_capture_output..Qwen3-4B-Base_TestCase_capture_output
git diff TestCase_capture_output..granite-3.3-2b-base_TestCase_capture_output
```
It has been seen that `setUp` method was used, but not in the expected way.

#### Revoke the Last Feedback Notes
Revoking of the last feedback.
```bash
git notes
git notes show 1e7f6e22104a28ab33fca3b34ca9c325a33f905d
git notes remove 1e7f6e22104a28ab33fca3b34ca9c325a33f905d
```

Please note that second and third commands are dependent on the result of the first command.

It has been seen that SymErgs responces use cached results.

#### Verify the Results
Verification of the commits:
```bash
git log TestCase_capture_output..Qwen3-4B-Base_TestCase_capture_output
git log TestCase_capture_output..granite-3.3-2b-base_TestCase_capture_output
```
It has been seen that a new commit "Revert: Use setUp method" appeared in both branches.

Verification of the code:
```bash
git diff TestCase_capture_output..Qwen3-4B-Base_TestCase_capture_output
git diff TestCase_capture_output..granite-3.3-2b-base_TestCase_capture_output
```
It has been seen that the cached generated code reappeared.

#### Provide more specific feedback
Pointing of SymErgs attention to the use of `setUp` method as a best practice in a more specific manner:
```bash
git notes add -m "Use setUp for specifying different functions producing output to be captured" Qwen3-4B-Base_TestCase_capture_output
```

It has been seen that SymErgion starts loadng coding models and generating code for the updated prompt.

It took `Qwen3-4B-Base` 114.4s to generate 266 new tokens and it took `granite-3.3-2b-base` 462.0s to generate 1692 new tokens.

#### Verify the Results
Verification of the prompt:
```bash
git log TestCase_capture_output..Qwen3-4B-Base_TestCase_capture_output
git log TestCase_capture_output..granite-3.3-2b-base_TestCase_capture_output
```
It has been seen that new commits have the notes with the last feedback as commit messages. Please note that when generating the response, they all notes are combined into one prompt.

Verification of the generated code:
```bash
git diff TestCase_capture_output..Qwen3-4B-Base_TestCase_capture_output
git diff TestCase_capture_output..granite-3.3-2b-base_TestCase_capture_output
```
It has been seen that `setUp` method is used in the expected way.

#### Last Changes
`Qwen3-4B-Base` repeated tested function code. To resolve it, the feedback to SymErgion could be provided or unnecessary code lines could be deleted manually. Considering that deleting is faster than writing feedback, it makes sense to do the last changes manually.

#### Verify TestCase
Run linters of your choice on the generated code.
Build the SymErgion image with the `test` tag to verify correctness of the written tests.
```bash
docker build --file Dockerfile.core --build-arg BASE_CONTAINER="image-of-your-preference" -t symergion:test .
```
If any error, it should be fixed manually or the last manual changes should be revert and the feedback regarding bug should be provided as a note.

Once code is verified commit all manual changes as one commit.

#### Stop SymErgion
```bash
docker-compose --env-file symergion.env down
```

### General remarks
It is a good practice to maintain several configuration files with different sets of SLMs, based on your experience of which SLM shows better results for specific codebases. Enriching the prompt using reasoning model(s) could improve overall quality with less compute, though it is not the case for all sorts of tasks. Note that you can assign more than one reasoner to specific configurations. In such case, they will produce reasoning parts independently and the prompt will be enriched with all of them combined.

Two to three coding SymErgs might be a good mix. Running more models will unnecessarily increase the completion time and ammount of consumed computational resources. Running solo model would make your SymErgion more susceptible to weak areas within a single model, as different models have different strengths and weaknesses.

Do not use `git reset` for SymErg branches, SymErgions' workflow doesn't support consistent work with inconsistent SymErg branches.
